# Monsignor Doyle App
## The App
This project started as an informational app for my highschool. The main pull for users was the ability to add their class schedule to the app, and have the times automatically adjust for flipweek (Periods 3 and 4 switched every week). The app also provided sources for school-related administrative information, an interactive map of the school, and a connection to the school social media.
## Success
The app was successfully sponsored by the school from 2014-2016 and publicised to incoming students throughout the year. I made changes to the app to support expansion to the other schools in the board using the same codebase, but unfortunately it was not further supported by the school board. I am very happy with what I did with the project, and hopefully helped some students out along the way.
